Code Base:
- [✔] Correct log form.
- [✔] Switch to new seed list.
    - Problem 1: If the agent fails once, maybe POMDP is no longer the same as MDP.
    - Problem 2: Maybe optimal strategy can include collisions.
- [] Plan agent prompt:
    - Make the format more reasonable.
- [] Scratch pad logic.
    - Yes:
        - Is Scratch pad empty?
        - No: 
            - Is the plan up-to-date(possible collide in the future)?
            - Yes: Follow plan
            - No:
                - Is the first action in the scratch pad a collision?
                - Yes: React
                - No: Plan
        - Yes: 
            - Will "STAY" lead to a collision?
            - Yes: React
            - No: Plan
- Continuous planning: Agent hasn't completed planning in the last turn(only when `token_per_tick` < `max_new_tokens`). 
    - During generation: Remind LLM of tokens left before this turn ends.
    - For Action: 
        - Option1: Force a none-action.
        - Option2: Extract generated plan to scratch pad and follow.
    - For Reasoning:
        - Option1: Keep reasoning.
        - Option2: Interrupt with new game state.
    - When total context >= `max_new_tokens`: (Use s1 to) force a stop.
