Code Base:
- [✔] Correct log form.
- [✔] Switch to new seed list.
    - Problem 1: If the agent fails once, maybe POMDP is no longer the same as MDP.
    - Problem 2: Maybe optimal strategy can include collisions.
- Budget forcing:
    - [✔] Prompted + s1.
    - [] Remind LLM with tokens left.
- [] Plan agent prompt:
    - Make the format more reasonable.
- [] Scratch pad logic.
    - Has "plan agent" completed thinking in the last turn?
    - Yes:
        - Is Scratch pad empty?
        - No: 
            - Is the plan up-to-date(possible collide in the future)?
            - Yes: Follow plan
            - No:
                - Is the first action in the scratch pad a collision?
                - Yes: React
                - No: Plan
        - Yes: 
            - Will "STAY" lead to a collision?
            - Yes: React
            - No: Plan
    - No(only when `token_per_tick` < `max_new_tokens`):
        - Force a none-action/Extract generated plan to scratch pad.
        - Go back to "yes"/Interrupt thinking with new game state.
