Code Base:
- [✔] Correct log form.
- [✔] Switch to new seed list.
    - Problem 1: If the agent fails once, maybe POMDP is no longer the same as MDP.
    - Problem 2: Maybe optimal strategy can include collisions.
- [] Plan agent prompt:
    - Make the format more reasonable.
- [] Scratch pad logic.
    - Is Scratch pad empty?
    - No: 
        - Is the plan up-to-date(no collision in the 3 steps)?
        - Yes: Follow plan
        - No:
            - Is the first action in the scratch pad a collision?
            - Yes: React
            - No: Plan
    - Yes: 
        - Will "STAY" lead to a collision?
        - Yes: React
        - No: Plan
- Continuous planning: Agent hasn't completed planning in the last turn(only when `token_per_tick` < `max_new_tokens`). 
    - For Reasoning:
        - [✔] Option1: Keep reasoning.
        - [] Option2: Interrupt with new game state.
    - For Action: 
        - [✔] Option1: Force a none-action.
        - [] Option2: Extract generated plan to scratch pad and follow.[Can be done in a s1 like way?]
    - During generation:
        - [✔] Option1: Do nothing.
        - [] Option2: Remind LLM of tokens left before this turn ends.
- Budget forcing:
    - When total context >= `max_new_tokens`: (Use s1 to) force a stop.
